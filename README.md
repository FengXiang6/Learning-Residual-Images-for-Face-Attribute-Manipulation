# Learning-Residual-Images-for-Face-Attribute-Manipulation

This code is implemented by TensorFlow, and the method of the code is from the paper [Learning Residual Images for Face Attribute Manipulation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Shen_Learning_Residual_Images_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) which is published in CVPR2017.

This paper is very interesting, it use GAN, dual learning and residual image to yield a high quilty image. Especially the method of residual image, i think it's a very nice idea.
