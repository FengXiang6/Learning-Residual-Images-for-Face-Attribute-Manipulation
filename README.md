# Learning-Residual-Images-for-Face-Attribute-Manipulation

This code is implemented by TensorFlow, and the method of the code is from the paper [Learning Residual Images for Face Attribute Manipulation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Shen_Learning_Residual_Images_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) which is published in CVPR2017.

This paper is very interesting, it use GAN, dual learning and residual image to yield a high quilty image. Especially the method of residual image, i think it's a very nice idea.

Method of the paper:

Result of our code:

![result](https://github.com/MingtaoGuo/Learning-Residual-Images-for-Face-Attribute-Manipulation/raw/master/result/ExpResult.jpg)

First row images are the original images, the second row images are the residual images, the third images are the result of the original image plus the residual image pixel element-wise. 

The experiment is about adding glasses on the face and removing glasses on the face.
